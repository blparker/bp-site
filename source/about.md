Hi there! Bryan here. I'm an engineer currently living in {{ site.author.city }}. I'm a passionate engineer with a wide array of interests.
I'm constantly trying to figure out ways to cross these interests (for better or worse):

  - **Software craftsmanship** - Constantly learning about creating quality software and optimizing my workflow.
  - **AI + Machine Learning** - Everything in the world is being instrumented with "smarts". For the past year, I've been on something of a learning
    journey to position myself at the leading edge of this dynamic field.
  - **Startups** - Have unsuccessfully thrown my hat into the startup ring before, but am always looking for opportunities that exist in the market.
  - **Sports** - Rabid college football fan.
  - **Food** - Self-proclaimed foodie. I enjoy the process of preparing a delicious meal (or at least I hope it's delicious) and sharing it with
    people I care about.
  - **Beer** - Enjoy craft beers and am beginning to take baby steps into my own brewing.
  - **Woodworking** - Like software, I like the prospect of being able to craft something out of nothing.

Feel free to reach out to {{ site.author.email }} to say hi.
