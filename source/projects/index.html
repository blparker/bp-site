<p>I tend to always have a project or 3 underway at a time. Here is a list of things I'm either
working on currently or have worked on in the past.</p>

<ul>
  {% for project in site.projects %}
  <li>
    <a href="{{ project.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">{{ project.title }}</a>
  </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

<div class="clearfix"></div>
